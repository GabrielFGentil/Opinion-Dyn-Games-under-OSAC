# Opinion Dynamic Games under One Step Ahead Optimal Control

This repository contains all the code needed to generate the article figures. Some extra codes and comparisons are also presented.

For all codes, the Julia ver language was used. 1.8.1, bundled with Jupyter Notebook. Each folder has 3 articles, namely:
 
  - ..._note, which is the main article and from which figures should be generated. In the file itself are the necessary instructions.
  - ..._code, which is the compilation of all the necessary functions for the notebook to work.
  - .._plots, which are the specific settings for each plot, in order to retrieve exactly the article's figures.
