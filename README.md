# Opinion Dynamic Games under One Step Ahead Optimal Control
This repository contains all the code necessary to generate the figures in the article. Also included are some additional codes and comparisons.
All codes were written in the Julia programming language version 1.8.1, bundled with Jupyter Notebook. In each folder, there are three articles, namely:

 - ..._note is the main article from which figures should be derived. Instructions are included in the file itself.
 - ..._code compiles all the functions necessary to run the notebook.
 - ..._plots, which are the specific settings for each plot, to retrieve precisely the article's figures.

If any questions, suggestions, or errors are found in the codes, email the correspondent in the article's body, and we will respond as quickly as possible.
